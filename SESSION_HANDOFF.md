# Session Handoff: Feature Branch Debug

## Context

**Branch:** `feature/verbose-logging-and-rate-limit-fixes`
**Status:** Has valuable features but causes excessive API calls
**Main Branch:** ‚úÖ Working perfectly (baseline)

## The Problem

When starting an agent on the feature branch, we see **46+ tool calls** instead of the expected **~2-3 calls**:

```
[Local‚ÜíRemote] tools/call (repeated 46+ times!)
Error: HTTP 429 - DDoS pattern detected
```

This triggers the server's DDoS protection. Main branch only makes 2 calls - clean and fast.

## Features Added in Feature Branch (Worth Keeping!)

### 1. Verbose Logging Toggle ‚≠ê
**Files:** `dashboard/frontend/app.js`, `index.html`, `style.css`

- Added "Verbose" checkbox in Live Logs UI
- Shows/hides full AI responses (the "üí¨ RESPONSE:" logs)
- Default: condensed view (just "ü§î Agent thinking...")
- Toggle on: see complete agent responses
- Works retroactively on existing logs

**Status:** ‚úÖ UI works great, just needs the backend verbose logs

### 2. Agent Filter Dropdown ‚≠ê
**Files:** `dashboard/frontend/app.js`, `index.html`, `style.css`

- Filter live logs by specific agent
- Dropdown auto-populates with running agent names
- Shows "All Agents" by default
- Real-time filtering of log display

**Status:** ‚úÖ Works perfectly

### 3. Full Response Logging
**Files:** `monitors/langgraph_monitor.py`, `monitors/ollama_monitor.py`

Added logging line:
```python
logger.info(f"üí¨ RESPONSE:\n{response}")  # Full, untruncated
```

Removed truncations like `content[:50]` and `content[:200]`

**Status:** ‚úÖ Works correctly

### 4. Custom MCP Tool Loader ‚ùå **THIS IS THE PROBLEM**
**File:** `mcp_manager.py`

**What it does:**
- Replaces `load_mcp_tools()` from langchain_mcp_adapters
- Builds tools manually from `list_tools()` schema
- Goal: Avoid excessive API calls

**The Issue:**
Something in this implementation causes 46+ tool calls instead of reducing them!

## What Works on Main

**Main branch tool loading flow:**
```python
# mcp_manager.py line 188
server_tools = await load_mcp_tools(session)
```

**API call pattern (CLEAN):**
```
[Local‚ÜíRemote] initialize
[Remote‚ÜíLocal] 0
[Local‚ÜíRemote] notifications/initialized
[Local‚ÜíRemote] tools/call   ‚Üê Just 1!
[Remote‚ÜíLocal] 1
[Local‚ÜíRemote] tools/list   ‚Üê Just 1!
[Remote‚ÜíLocal] 2
```

Total: 2 calls per agent startup. Fast and clean!

## What Breaks on Feature Branch

**Feature branch tool loading:**
```python
# Custom implementation in mcp_manager.py lines 175-271
# Builds tools manually from schemas
```

**API call pattern (BROKEN):**
```
[Local‚ÜíRemote] initialize
[Remote‚ÜíLocal] 0
[Local‚ÜíRemote] notifications/initialized
[Local‚ÜíRemote] tools/call   ‚Üê Call 2
[Remote‚ÜíLocal] 2
[Local‚ÜíRemote] tools/call   ‚Üê Call 3
[Remote‚ÜíLocal] 3
... (continues to 46+)
Error: DDoS pattern detected
```

## Root Cause Analysis Needed

**Questions to investigate:**

1. **Why 46 calls?** We have ~25 tools total (5+6+14). Why almost 2x that?

2. **Where do the calls come from?**
   - Is the custom tool loader calling tools during creation?
   - Is something else triggering tool validation?
   - Are there duplicate tool registrations?

3. **Main vs Feature comparison:**
   - Main: Uses `load_mcp_tools()` ‚Üí 2 calls
   - Feature: Custom loader ‚Üí 46+ calls
   - What does `load_mcp_tools()` do differently?

4. **Hypothesis:** The custom implementation might be:
   - Calling tools to test them (shouldn't be)
   - Creating tools multiple times (shouldn't be)
   - Triggering LangChain validation that calls tools (possible)

## Debug Strategy

### Step 1: Compare Implementations
```bash
git checkout main
# Look at: src/ax_agent_studio/mcp_manager.py lines 175-198

git checkout feature/verbose-logging-and-rate-limit-fixes
# Look at: src/ax_agent_studio/mcp_manager.py lines 175-271
```

### Step 2: Add Debug Logging
In the feature branch custom tool loader, add:
```python
logger.info(f"üîç Creating tool: {tool_name} (no calls should happen here)")
# ... tool creation code ...
logger.info(f"‚úÖ Tool created: {tool_name} (should be 0 API calls)")
```

### Step 3: Check LangChain Behavior
The `StructuredTool` constructor might be calling tools for validation. Check:
- Does `StructuredTool.__init__` call the tool?
- Does setting both `func` and `coroutine` cause double calls?
- Is there a `validate=False` parameter?

### Step 4: Isolate the Feature
Try merging features individually:
1. Merge just verbose logging (monitors + frontend) ‚Üí test
2. Merge just agent filter (frontend only) ‚Üí test
3. Merge custom tool loader last ‚Üí identify exact breaking point

## Key Files to Review

### Working (Main Branch)
- `src/ax_agent_studio/mcp_manager.py` lines 175-198

### Broken (Feature Branch)
- `src/ax_agent_studio/mcp_manager.py` lines 175-271

### Worth Keeping
- `src/ax_agent_studio/dashboard/frontend/app.js` (verbose + filter)
- `src/ax_agent_studio/dashboard/frontend/index.html` (UI)
- `src/ax_agent_studio/dashboard/frontend/style.css` (styles)
- `src/ax_agent_studio/monitors/langgraph_monitor.py` (line 840: full response log)
- `src/ax_agent_studio/monitors/ollama_monitor.py` (line 133: full response log)

## Success Criteria

Feature branch should:
1. ‚úÖ Make only 2-3 API calls per agent startup (like main)
2. ‚úÖ Show verbose logging toggle in UI
3. ‚úÖ Show agent filter dropdown
4. ‚úÖ Log full responses without truncation
5. ‚úÖ Not trigger rate limits or DDoS protection

## Testing

### Test on Main (Baseline)
```bash
git checkout main
./scripts/start_dashboard.sh
# Start agent ‚Üí Count API calls in output
# Expected: 2 calls (1 tools/call, 1 tools/list)
```

### Test on Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout feature/verbose-logging-and-rate-limit-fixes
./scripts/start_dashboard.sh
# Start agent ‚Üí Count API calls in output
# Current: 46+ calls ‚ùå
# Goal: 2-3 calls ‚úÖ
```

## Additional Context

### Server-Side Changes
@code_weaver fixed rate limits on aX server:
- Increased to 300 req/min (was 120)
- Burst capacity: 1000 (was 20)
- Discovery methods (tools/list) exempt from limits

So rate limiting is less strict now, but 46 calls still triggers DDoS protection.

### Original Issue
- Started with 429 rate limit errors
- Tried to fix by reducing API calls
- Accidentally made it worse (46 calls instead of reducing)
- Main branch was always fine, we just panicked

## Recommended Approach

1. **Cherry-pick the good features:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git checkout feature/verbose-logging-and-rate-limit-fixes -- \
     src/ax_agent_studio/dashboard/frontend/ \
     src/ax_agent_studio/monitors/langgraph_monitor.py \
     src/ax_agent_studio/monitors/ollama_monitor.py
   ```

2. **Test if these work without the tool loader changes**

3. **If tool loader is really needed:**
   - Study what `load_mcp_tools()` does
   - Understand why our version makes 46 calls
   - Fix the implementation or abandon it

## Notes

- Main branch is the source of truth - it works perfectly
- Don't overthink or panic - the original code was fine
- The verbose logging features are valuable and should be preserved
- The custom tool loader can be abandoned if it's too complex
- Sometimes the library knows better than we do!

---

**Session Goal:** Get feature branch working with same clean 2-call pattern as main, while keeping the UI enhancements.

**Remember:** Main works. Start from there. Add features incrementally. Test after each addition.
